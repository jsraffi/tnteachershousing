                    <p>Teachers are the building blocks of the society &ndash; a dedicated lot who contributed their youthful &amp; experienced shinning years in building the society brick by brick. Society owes a sense of indebtedness towards each and every one of them.</p>
                    <p>They are the true leaders, a lighthouse of knowledge and wisdom, who can liberate the society from the present mess. &nbsp;But their socio-economic status is challenged with questions. By being associated together at a socially viable platform and to work collectively for a noble cause it is overwhelming, as envisaged.</p>
                    <p>But, a hard fact, at the height of their career, booming with energy and motivation, best brains of academicians and professors superannuated. Their Welfare remains uncared for the benefit and development of the society - a colossal national loss.</p>
                    <p>In view of uniting all the Teachers irrespective of their grade such as Primary or Secondary Grade Graduate or College lecturers and Professors etc., and all other ministerial staffs attached to educational community or institutions, to take care of the welfare of their families, the Tamilnadu Teachers Housing &amp; Welfare Trust has been formed.</p>
                    <p>The Trust, as its service theme, has made a modest, but significant, beginning to promote the Teachers Community to march forward and contribute their rightful, in the process of social re-construction, through their fruitful participation in housing and other welfare projects.</p>
